This is my project for https://class.coursera.org/getdata-011/

It works by reading in the source files from the "UCI HAR Dataset" folder:
* features.txt
* activity\_labels.txt
* test/X\_test.txt
* test/y\_test.txt
* test/subject\_test.txt
* train/X\_train.txt
* train/y\_train.txt
* train/subject\_train.txt

The files are joined, merged, and filtered according to the Transformations section of the CodeBook.md file.
